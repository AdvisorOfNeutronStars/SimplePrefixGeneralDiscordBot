# SimplePrefixGeneralDiscordBot

I will eventually be updating this a bit more later on.

All you need to do is edit the presense and create your .env file with your bot config.

Also do not forget to rename .env-Example to .env once setup.

The only prefix set for this bot currently is '>' you can change it however, by going to index.js file and changing this:

if (!message.content.startsWith('>') || message.author.bot) return; 

where the '>' you can change the > to whatever, like if (!message.content.startsWith('?') || message.author.bot) return;
